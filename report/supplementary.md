# Figure S1: Effect of sector order

![**Relationship between sector order and choices.** Points show marginal means of the forced choices of policy packages within the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. Subgroups of our sample with different sector order are shown using varying opacity. Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

# Figure S4: Rating-based effects

![**Population average preferences regarding attributes of policy packages.** Points show the average marginal component effects of the ratings of policy packages in the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. The points show the estimated decrease or increase in ratings, relative to the baseline level (first level of each attribute). Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

# Figure S7: Relationship between climate change concern and ratings

![**Relationship between climate change concern and policy preferences.** Points show marginal means of the ratings of policy packages in the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. Subgroups of our sample with varying climate concern are shown using varying opacity (higher opacity represents higher climate concern). Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval.
