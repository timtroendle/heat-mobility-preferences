# Figure S1: Effect of sector order

![**Relationship between sector order and choices.** Points show marginal means of the forced choices of policy packages within the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. Subgroups of our sample with different sector order are shown using varying opacity. Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval. There were n=1,780 respondents and 17’800 policy packages.](build/paper/amce-choice-by-First.png){#fig:First tag="S1"}

# Figure S2: Effect of choice task repetition

![**Relationship between choice task repetition and choices.** Points show marginal means of the forced choices of policy packages within the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. Choice tasks per respondent are shown using varying opacity. Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

# Figure S4: Effect of filtering speeders

![**Relationship between filtering speeders and choices.** Points show marginal means of the forced choices of policy packages within the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. Data with and without filtering respondents that speeded through the experiment are shown using varying opacity. Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

# Figure S5: Experimental design

![**Attribute level correlations of our experimental designs.** Colour of rectangles shows the number of times two attribute levels occurred together within one profile. The experiments contain n=17'800 policy packges.](build/paper/choice-experimental-design.png){#fig:experimental-design tag="S5"}

# Figure S6: Relationship between climate change concern and ratings

![**Relationship between climate change concern and policy preferences.** Points show marginal means of the ratings of policy packages in the building (left) and transport (right) sectors. Subgroups of our sample with varying climate concern are shown using varying opacity (higher opacity represents higher climate concern). Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval. There were n=1,780 respondents and 17,800 policy packages.](build/paper/mm-rating-by-cceval_cat.png){#fig:rating-cceval tag="S6"}
