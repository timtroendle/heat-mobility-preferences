**Low-carbon framing**

To achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, fossil fuels (oil,
natural gas, coal) must no longer be used by 2050 at the latest.
Existing measures to promote climate-friendly alternatives have already
had a positive impact: More and more households own an electric car and
heat with renewable energy. This trend must continue. To limit global
warming to 1.5°C, it is crucial that climate-friendly technologies
prevail.

*Timing*

**Phase-out framing**

To achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, fossil fuels (oil,
natural gas, coal) must no longer be used by 2050 at the latest.
Existing measures to promote climate-neutral alternatives have already
had a positive impact. But this is not enough. To limit global warming
to 1.5°C, all combustion engines (petrol and diesel cars) and all fossil
heating systems must be removed.

*Timing*

**Instructions conjoint experiment**

We now ask you some questions about your preferences regarding different
policy measures for CO~2~ reduction in the areas of private mobility and
heating. You will be shown different policy packages that differ in one
or more aspects. Please compare these policy packages and indicate your
preference. If you do not fully endorse any of the packages, choose the
one you would rather adopt.

The packages will be composed of four elements:

-   The phase-out year describes the target year in which the respective
    fossil technology (petrol and diesel cars
    and fossil heating systems) should no longer be used

-   Measures relating to the purchase

-   Measures relating to the use

-   Supporting measures that mitigate potentially negative impacts

Below you will now see an overview of the answer options:
